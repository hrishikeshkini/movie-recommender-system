## Problem Statement
Dog Breed Identification
Determine the breed of a dog in an image
In todayâ€™s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity.

## Approach
Data Exploration : I started exploring dataset using pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn.

Feature Engineering : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.

Pickle File : created pickle file as per need.

User Interface & deployment :  Created an UI with a form that take the necessary inputs from user and shows the 5 recommended movies.
                          After that I have deployed project on heroku.
## Technologies Used
