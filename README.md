## Problem Statement
Dog Breed Identification
Determine the breed of a dog in an image
In todayâ€™s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity.

## Approach
Data Exploration : I started exploring dataset using pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn.

Data visualization : Ploted graphs to get insights about dependend and independed variables.

Feature Engineering : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.

Model Building & Testing : Tried many machine learning algorithms and checked the base accuracy to find the best fit.

Pickle File : Selected model as per best accuracy and created pickle file.

User Interface & deployment :  Created an UI with a form that takes all the necessary inputs from user and shows the output.
                          After that I have deployed project on heroku.

## Deployement on Heroku
Create a virtual app on Heroku Cloud. You can either connect your github profile or download cli to manually deploy this project.
Follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

## Bugs & Logs

1. If you find a bug, kindly open an issue and it will be addressed as early as possible. [Open](https://github.com/hrishikeshkini/movie-recommender-system/issues)
2. Under localhost, logging is performed for all the actions and its stored onto logs.txt file
3. When the app is deployed on heroku, logs can be viewed on  heroku dashboard or CLI.
